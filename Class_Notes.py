LIST COMPREHENSION: Create a new list from a previous list.

BOTH EXAMPLES PRODUCE THE SAME OUTPUT
######################################################
# Example 1: Original way.
numbers = [1,2,3]
new_list = []
for n in numbers:
    add_1 = n + 1
    new_list.append(add_1)

# Example 2: Using list comprehension.
numbers = [1,2,3]
new_list = [operation for item in list] # How to use
new_list = [n + 1 for n in numbers] # Example
######################################################

name = "Ryder"
new_list = [letter for letter in name]
# OUTPUT: ['R', 'y', 'd', 'e', 'r']
######################################################

# CONDITIONAL LIST COMPREHENSION
result = [NAMED_ANYTHING for NAMED_ANYTHING in numbers if NAMED_ANYTHING % 2 == 0]
new_list = [new_item for item in list if test] # Item can be called anything you want

names = ["Alex","Joe","Roger","PeterMcPeterson"]
# new_list = [name for name in names if len(name) < 5]
newlist = [nom.upper() for nom in names if len(nom) < 5]
print(newlist)
######################################################

new_list = [new_item for item in list if test]
new_list = [SAME_NAME for SAME_NAME in list if SAME_NAME]

Hereâ€™s what each part does:

1. new_item: This is the expression that defines what each element of the new list will be. It can be any expression involving item.
   new_item: The operation or transformation applied to item that defines what gets included in the new list.

2. item: This is a variable that takes each value from the iterable (e.g., list) one by one.
   item: Each element from the original list (or any iterable).

3. list: This is the iterable (e.g., a list) that you are iterating over.
   list: The list you are pulling from. 

4. test: This is an optional condition (a boolean expression). Only items for which this condition evaluates to True are included in the new list.
   test: A condition that must be true for the item to be included in the new list

 
What Can Be in Each Place:
new_item: Any expression that can use item. It can be a calculation, a function call, a transformation, etc. Example: number**2, str(item), item * 2, item.upper().
item: Any variable name that you use to represent each element of the iterable. This name should be used consistently within the comprehension.
list: Any iterable (e.g., list, tuple, set, dictionary keys or values, string).
test: Any boolean expression that can use item. This is optional, and if omitted, all items from the iterable are included. Example: item % 2 == 0, len(item) > 3, item.startswith('A').

DICTIONARY COMPREHENSION

New_dict = {new_key: new_value for item in list}
New_dict = {new_key: new_value for (key, value) in dict.items()}
New_dict = {new_key: new_value for (key, value) in dict.items() if test}


# So, when we make a new dictionary using a loop, like this:
# {new_key: new_value for (key, value) in dict.items()}
# new_key is like a box where we put the name for the thing we want to store.
# new_value is like the thing we want to store itself.
# We can use the same names as before (key and value), or we can use different names (new_key and new_value).
# It's like giving a nickname to the thing we're storing!
# If we want to change the name or the thing itself, we can do that too! Like this:
# {key.upper(): value for (key, value) in dict.items()}


Example: Generate random score for each student.
    names = ['Alex', 'Beth', 'Caroline', 'Dave', 'Elenor', 'Freddie']
    import random
    students_scores = {student: random.randint(1, 100) for student in names}

Example.
    import random
    names = ['Alex', 'Beth', 'Caroline', 'Dave', 'Elenor', 'Freddie']
    students_scores = {student: random.randint(1,100) for student in names}
    print(students_scores)
    # passed = {new_key: new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items() if value > 60}
    passed = {student: score for (student, score) in students_scores.items() if score > 60}
    print(passed)

Example.
    # CREATE A DICTIONARY RESULT WITH WORD LENGTHS FROM THE GIVEN SENTENCE.
    sentence = "What is the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow?"
    list = sentence.split()
    print(list)
    result = {number: len(number) for number in list}
    print(result)
